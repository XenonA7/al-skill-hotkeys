### Custom Skill Menu
This hotkey opens the custom skill menu so you can change your custom skill loadout. Anytime, anywhere. Even during combat.

### Custom Skill Toggle
This hotkey will toggle the **Custom C. Preset** inventory item on and off. Doesn't do anything unless you actually have the item. Pressing it will show a green hacking effect on your character.
